## Why Starlarky

We hope to provide a shortcut on the path to confidential computing, using a framework with enough flexibility to be useful
and a syntax which should be familiar to anyone who knows Python.


## Installation

Fork this repository to create a local instance which you can use to test extensions. We're looking into packaging for the usual
formats, so that you can eventually `brew`, `apt`, `dnf` or `nuget` as needed.
